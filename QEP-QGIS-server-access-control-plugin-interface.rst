#. Summary
----------

Add the possibility to create python plugin for access control
to all the services of QGIS server,

The plugin will implements the following interface:


 * ``layerFilter`` Return an additional filter, used in WMS/GetMap,
   WMS/GetFeatureInfo, WFS/GetFeature to filter the features.
 * ``layerPermissions`` Change the rights on the layer per user
   (known by the plugin). The concerned rights are: publish, insert, update,
   delete. Mostly used in WFS/Transaction, and the publish in all requests.
 * ``authorizedLayerAttributes`` Be able to show some attributes only for a
   subset of user Used in: WMS/GetFeatureInfo, WFS/GetFeature.
 * ``allowToEdit`` Be able to disallow the edition of a particular feature,
   in our case base on the Geometry Used in: WFS/Transaction.

Our need is to be able to do the following kind of restrictions::

 * Geometric restriction that depends on the connected user and the layer.
 * Attributes restriction that depends on the connected user and the layer.

All the knowledge about which user is connected and on what he is allowed to
access is the responsability of the plugin.

``layerFilter`` and ``allowToEdit`` fill nearly the same use case,
but ``layerFilter`` is optimised to create requests and concerns the read access,
and ``allowToEdit`` is optimised to be used on an existing feature object
and concerns the write access.

#. Implementation Details
-------------------------

See: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2056.

I create a new kind of server plugin and I don't extend the current server filter
for the following reason::

 * We already many issue by fintring things in a generated xml file.
 * The plugin implementation will be relay complex.
 * The FEATURE_COUNT won't correctly work with hooks.


#.# Python Bindings
...................

See summary.

#.# Affected Files
..................

See: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2056/files.

#. Test Coverage
----------------

I don't know how we can do unit test for this. I think one possibility is to
run the server on apache, and test the query results.

#. Performance Implications
---------------------------

Should be really low if there no plugin that implements it.
Also depends on the plugin implementation.

#. Backwards Compatibility
--------------------------

New interface, then no incidence.

#. Documentation
----------------

We can create restriction access python plugin.

The class to implements is ``qgis.server.qgsaccesscontrolplugin``.

The optional methods to implement are:

#.# ``layerFilter``
...................

Return a filter for the map that will be used in the following requests::

 * WMS/GetMap
 * WMS/GetFeatureInfo
 * WFS/GetFeature

#.# ``layerPermissions``
........................

Restrict the permissions on the layer. The concerned rights are:
publish, insert, update and delete.

The publish permission is used in all the request that concern a layer
including the ``GetCapabilities``.

The others permissions are be used in the WFS/Transaction.

#.# ``authorizedLayerAttributes``
.................................

Restrict the published feature attributes.

Used in the following requests::

 * WMS/GetFeatureInfo
 * WFS/GetFeature

#.# ``allowToEdit``

Disallow the edition of a specific kind of feature.

Used in the following requests::
 * WFS/Transaction

#.# Python lugin example
------------------------

.. code:: python

    from qgis.server import QgsServerAccessControlFilter

    def serverClassFactory(serverIface):
        serverIface.registerSecurity( ExampleAC(serverIface) )

    class ExampleAc(QgsServerAccessControlFilter):

        # Return an additional expression filter
        def getLayerFilter(self, layer):
            # access only to element with ID 1
            return "1 = $id"

        # Return the layer rights
        def getLayerRights(self, layer):
            # access only to layer country
            rights = QgsServerSecurity.LayerRights()
            rights.publish = layer.name() != "Country"
            return rights

        # Return the authorised layer attributes
        def getAuthorizedLayerAttributes(self, layer, attributes):
            # access only to the attribute named "name"
            return [attrib for attrib in attributes if attrib == "name"]

        # Are we authorise to modify the following geometry
        def allowToEdit(self, layer, feature):
            # allow to edit only the feature with id 1
            return feature.id == 1
